#In this example, we have a chained conditional.
# The code checks multiple conditions one after another using if, elif, and else.
# It first checks if the average is less than 50, then if it's between 50 and 75, and finally,
# if none of those conditions are met, it executes the last else block.



a = b = 123



#‘3’ = 3
